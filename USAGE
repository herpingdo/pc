pc is a stack-based calculator that operates on double-precision floating point numbers.
There are a few operators/commands which you can type on the REPL. They are listed below:

+: Pop two numbers off of the stack, add them, and push the result.
-: Pop two numbers off of the stack, subtract the second from the first, and push the result.
*: Pop two numbers off of the stack, multiply them, and push the result.
/: Pop two numbers off of the stack, divide the first by the second, and push the result.
^: Pop two numbers off of the stack, push the result of pow(first, second)
v: Pop one number off of the stack, push the square root of this number.
p: Pop one number off of the stack, print it, and then discard it.
d: Duplicate the top number on the stack.
s: Show the stack.
S: Swap the top two stack elements.

Everything else is considered a C `double`, and parsed and pushed onto the stack as one.
EOF (^D) exits.
